# Data Directory

This directory contains output data files generated by the web scraping projects.

## File Naming Convention

Files are automatically named with the following pattern:
```
{query}_{timestamp}.{format}
```

Examples:
- `gaming_laptops_20260120_162000.csv`
- `python_developer_jobs_20260120_162000.json`
- `headlines_20260120_162000.csv`

## Formats

Data may be saved in the following formats:
- **CSV**: Tabular data, easily imported into spreadsheets
- **JSON**: Structured data, easily parsed programmatically

## Cleanup

You can safely delete old data files when no longer needed. This directory is git-ignored to prevent accidentally committing large datasets.
